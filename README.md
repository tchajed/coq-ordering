# Coq ordering library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/coq-ordering.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/coq-ordering)

A typeclass for complete orders, along with some instances. We provide an
instance for lists. We also provide an instance for strings using an injection
to lists and a generic instance.
